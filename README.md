# UCSB Isla Vista Arrest Location Heatmaps

This project involves creating heatmaps to visualize arrest patterns in Isla Vista, CA, from September to November 2024, using SQLite to store and query location data and integrating GeoPy with Leaflet to map and display the data for an article in UCSB's student-run newspaper, the *Daily Nexus*.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create detailed heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution and concentration of arrests in Isla Vista, CA, during the early academic months of September to Novemeber 2024. The heatmaps were developed to  accompany and enhance an article written in the *Daily Nexus*, UC Santa Barbara's independent, student-run newspaper. The article, "*Substance-related and theft-related arrests rise in Isla Vista over the last two months*", was written by me (Anna Gornyitzki) and Aastha Prakash.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* SQLite Database
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python Libraries
* Data

### Installing
Disclaimer: This is an installation guide for macOS.

**Step 1: Install SQLite using Homebrew (a package manager for macOS)**
```
brew install sqlite
```

**Step 2: Install Database tool such as DBeaver**

https://dbeaver.io/download/

**Step 3: Install Jupyter**
1. Install Python
   Python 2.x is usually pre-installed on macOS, but you'll want to install latest version (Python 3.x) using Homebrew.
```
brew install python
```
2. Verify Python Installation
```
python --version # or python3 --version on some systems
```
3. Verify pip Installation
```
pip --version # or pip3 --version on some systems
```
If pip is not installed do it manually
```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
3. Install Jupyter through pip
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

## Step by Step Guide

### Prepare and Load Data
### 1. Extract Data from PDF to CSV
1. **Tool Used:** [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/)  
2. **Steps:**
   - Download the PDF from [UCSB Police Department's Daily Crime and Fire Log](https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/UCSB_Crime_Fire_Log.pdf) containing the tabular data.

**You can skip these steps and access the CSV in [Data](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/tree/main/Data) folder**

### 2. Import CSV file into relational database
Import CSV file into SQLite using DBeaver
1. **Tool Used:** [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)  
2. **Steps:**
   - Create a new SQLite database named arrestData.db.
   - Use the `CSV Import Wizard` in DBeaver to load the CSV into a table named UCSB_Crime_Fire_Log:
     - Go to **Database > Tools > Import Data**.
   - Verify the data is correctly imported by running a `SELECT * FROM UCSB_Crime_Fire_Log ucfl;` query.

**You can access table definition arrestDataTable.sql in [Database](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/tree/main/Database) folder**

### 3. Test SQLite Queries
1. Use DBeaver to test various SQLite queries on the imported table:
   - Perform data filtering, aggregation, and transformations to analyze the data.
   - Save the queries that yield useful insights for later use in Jupyter Notebook.

**You can access SQL queries arrestQueries.sql in [Database](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/tree/main/Database) folder**

### Using Data to Create Heatmaps
### 4. Create Heatmaps in Jupyter Notebook
**Tool Used:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)  
To create the heatmaps, I included three Jupyter notebooks, each representing a different trial. When I encountered an obstacle, I started a new trial. I have three approaches for visualizing the data, each represented by a separate notebook. The first approach displays a generic heatmap with no counts, the second incorporates counts to show the frequency of occurrences, and the third visualizes clusters, dynamically adjusting the counts for when the user resizes the maps. In the notebooks, I used Python libraries such as Geopy for geocoding addresses and Folium for generating the heatmaps. The data was processed, and the relevant latitude and longitude values were extracted to create visual representations of the heatmaps.

**You can access the notebooks in [Jupyter](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/tree/main/Jupyter) folder**

**Trial 1: No Counts**

Consists of these high level steps:
1. Load Data and Prepare Addresses

In this step, I initially used Geopy’s **Nominatim** geocoder to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates from addresses. However, I encountered issues because Nominatim had trouble recognizing certain address formats, such as "blk" for block or other non-standard abbreviations, resulting in failed or inaccurate geocoding. To resolve this, I switched to **Geopy’s GoogleV3** geocoder, which provided better accuracy in retrieving latitude and longitude coordinates. GoogleV3 handled a wider range of address formats and required less manual data manipulation, allowing me to focus on the analysis rather than fixing geocoding errors.

2. Geocode the Addresses
3. Create and Display the Heatmap
Specific steps of how to visualize interactive heatmaps are written in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/blob/main/Jupyter/ArrestHeatmapTrial1.ipynb)


**Trial 2: Counts**

The key difference in this trial is the inclusion of counts in the SQL queries.
Consists of these high level steps:
1. Load Data and Prepare Addresses
2. Geocode and Address Cleanup
3. Generate and Save Coordinates with Counts
4. Create Heatmap Data and Layer
5. Display Heatmap
Specific steps of how to visualize interactive heatmaps are written in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/blob/main/Jupyter/ArrestHeatmapTrial2.ipynb)

**Trial 3: Cluster**

The key difference in this trial is letting Python handle the counts and Cluster perform the counting for me.
Consists of these high level steps:
1. Load Data and Prepare Addresses
2. Geocode the Addresses
3. Adding Counts to a Marker Cluster
4. Create and Display Heatmap
Specific steps of how to visualize interactive heatmaps are written in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/annagornyitzki/ucsb-islavista-arrest-heatmap/blob/main/Jupyter/ArrestHeatmapTrial3.ipynb)
