# UCSB Isla Vista Arrest Location Heatmaps

This project created heatmaps to visualize arrest patterns in Isla Vista, CA, from September to November 2024, using SQLite to store and query location data and integrating GeoPy with Leaflet to map and display the data for an article in UCSB's student-run newspaper, the *Daily Nexus*.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create detailed heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution and concentration of arrests in Isla Vista, CA, during the early academic months of September to Novemeber 2024. The heatmaps were developed to  accompany and enhance an article written in the *Daily Nexus*, UC Santa Barbara's independent, student-run newspaper. The article, "*Substance-related and theft-related arrests rise in Isla Vista over the last two months*", was written by me (Anna Gornyitzki) and Aastha Prakash.
